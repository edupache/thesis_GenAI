       " 'There are many tips to stay safe on the road during the holiday season, but here are some of the most important ones:\\n\\n\\nShare your travel plans with loved ones. Before you leave for your family get-together, let your loved ones know your travel plans. Let them know when you are leaving, the route you are taking, and when you plan to arrive. That way, they can check in on you regularly and know when to get help if you are absent. The last thing you want to do is to break down or spin off the road without service and have no way of contacting help.\\n\\n\\nDo not post your travel plans on social media. While it may be tempting to share your holiday adventures with your friends and followers, doing so can also alert criminals that your home is unoccupied and vulnerable. To prevent burglaries and thefts,\\nkeep your travel plans private and secure your home before you leave.\\n\\n\\nLeave early and plan ahead for heavy traffic. The holiday season is a busy time for travel, and you may encounter delays, detours, or congestion on the road. To avoid stress and frustration, give yourself extra time to get to your destination, and check the traffic and road conditions before you leave. You can also use apps or websites that provide real-time traffic information and alternative routes.\\n\\n\\nGet a good night’s sleep before departing and avoid drowsy driving. Driving\\nwhile tired can impair your judgment, reaction time, and awareness. If you feel\\nsleepy, pull over to a safe place and take a nap or switch drivers. Avoid driving during your normal sleeping hours, and take regular breaks every two hours or 100 miles\\n\\n\\nAvoid distractions while driving, such as using your cell phone to text, email, or access social media. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for at least five seconds. At 55 miles per hour, that is like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed.\\n\\n\\nCheck the weather conditions before you head out on the road. Make sure to drive at a speed that is safe for road and weather conditions. If you encounter snow or ice, decrease your speed, leave yourself plenty of room behind other vehicles, and avoid driving until roads have been plowed and sanded\\n\\n\\nPrepare your car for winter and keep an emergency kit with you. Before hitting the road on a long trip, get a full inspection of your vehicle to make sure everything is working properly. Pack an emergency kit that includes items such as a first aid kit, cold weather essentials, basic car repair tools, and potty gear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@Jacob_Kondrasuk \\n@david_rosati \\n@Scott_Richwine \\n@Keionna_Lee \\n@matthew_peddycord \\n@Adam_Wintersteen \\n@richard_campbell \\n@Alexander_Amerman \\n@David_Wildey \\n@Jimmy_Green',\n",

Check for tears in the clothing and wear and tear on your boots (including the tread) \\n 2) Wash your clothing regularly in COLD water with no bleach. They can be washed up to 25 times \\n 3) Check the hard hat weekly for cracks or general wear and tear. Look under the front lip to check for a manufacture date. It is recommended your Hard Hat be replaced every 4 years\\n 4) Are your Safety Gloves worn out? Any holes or tears? \\n 5) Finally, what about your Safety Glasses? They are your last line of defense against an eye injury\\n\\n\\nWhen your PPE is worn OR  is unable to be cleaned, request a replacement from your Area Supervisor or Safety Professional. Our PPE when clean and in good condition can be the difference in having a safe day and a potential incident occurring.',\n",

       " \"To kick off our campaign, let's talk about what we do most.... Flag! Remember, traffic will tell you if there's something wrong with your\\nzone! When it comes to flagging there are a few tips we have for when things go\\nwrong. Sure, it may be motorist error, but have we checked ourselves first?\\n \\n1.        Is traffic continuing to run your paddle? Make sure that you are\\nstanding in a visible place. Can traffic see you? Be sure to stay away from\\nblind curves and hills. These can take away from reaction time to the\\nmotorists. \\n2.        Also make sure you are not standing in front of obstructions\\nlike road signs and telephone poles. And as nice as the shade is on a hot day,\\nit can hide the brightness and retro-reflectivity of your PPE. \\n3.        When Mobile Flagging, if traffic keeps cutting between your\\nshadow vehicle and the client, your shadow vehicle may be too far from the\\nclient. Follow your proper roll ahead distance and stay clear of blind curves\\nand hills. \\n4.        Keep in mind that we want to have safe flagging locations with\\nescape routes AND proper site distance so we can be SEEN.\\n \\nStay tuned over the next few weeks for more tips on our other operations! We look forward to hearing your feedback. What are some tips you\\nhave to share with us?\",\n",

Little did I remember that exactly one year ago today I had obtained my truck; from CL to ACL in a few short months there after. I can’t help be proud of my accomplishments thus far with the company. \\n\\nI never thought I’d find a career field that I love and have a deep passion for. Every aspect of our job comes with many obstacles and new challenges. Some hard then others but never unable to overcome. A field that has taught me to always stay teachable, shut up and listen, always stay focused, never lose sight of my surroundings at all times and most importantly NO matter what never stop communicating (crew, client, and anyone in between) (clear communication always makes for a better work place. ).\\n\\nAnyways, Flagger force has opened up my eyes to a whole new future and I can’t be more excited for the journey I have ahead of me. Knowing that working in SC will be a few week project, I can’t help but feel honored to be selected as one of the few to go down and represent FF in hopes to obtain more work in the area.

       " 'There are many tips to stay safe on the road during the holiday season, but here are some of the most important ones:\\n\\n\\nShare your travel plans with loved ones. Before you leave for your family get-together, let your loved ones know your travel plans. Let them know when you are leaving, the route you are taking, and when you plan to arrive. That way, they can check in on you regularly and know when to get help if you are absent. The last thing you want to do is to break down or spin off the road without service and have no way of contacting help.\\n\\n\\nDo not post your travel plans on social media. While it may be tempting to share your holiday adventures with your friends and followers, doing so can also alert criminals that your home is unoccupied and vulnerable. To prevent burglaries and thefts,\\nkeep your travel plans private and secure your home before you leave.\\n\\n\\nLeave early and plan ahead for heavy traffic. The holiday season is a busy time for travel, and you may encounter delays, detours, or congestion on the road. To avoid stress and frustration, give yourself extra time to get to your destination, and check the traffic and road conditions before you leave. You can also use apps or websites that provide real-time traffic information and alternative routes.\\n\\n\\nGet a good night’s sleep before departing and avoid drowsy driving. Driving\\nwhile tired can impair your judgment, reaction time, and awareness. If you feel\\nsleepy, pull over to a safe place and take a nap or switch drivers. Avoid driving during your normal sleeping hours, and take regular breaks every two hours or 100 miles\\n\\n\\nAvoid distractions while driving, such as using your cell phone to text, email, or access social media. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for at least five seconds. At 55 miles per hour, that is like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed.\\n\\n\\nCheck the weather conditions before you head out on the road. Make sure to drive at a speed that is safe for road and weather conditions. If you encounter snow or ice, decrease your speed, leave yourself plenty of room behind other vehicles, and avoid driving until roads have been plowed and sanded\\n\\n\\nPrepare your car for winter and keep an emergency kit with you. Before hitting the road on a long trip, get a full inspection of your vehicle to make sure everything is working properly. Pack an emergency kit that includes items such as a first aid kit, cold weather essentials, basic car repair tools, and potty gear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@Jacob_Kondrasuk \\n@david_rosati \\n@Scott_Richwine \\n@Keionna_Lee \\n@matthew_peddycord \\n@Adam_Wintersteen \\n@richard_campbell \\n@Alexander_Amerman \\n@David_Wildey \\n@Jimmy_Green',\n",

After visiting with Craig, I toured the balance of work sites in Wilkes Barre, both ours and our competition and found that CRAIG WAS RIGHT!  🙂  Thank you Craig for your leadership, professionalism and dedication!

Check for tears in the clothing and wear and tear on your boots (including the tread) \\n 2) Wash your clothing regularly in COLD water with no bleach. They can be washed up to 25 times \\n 3) Check the hard hat weekly for cracks or general wear and tear. Look under the front lip to check for a manufacture date. It is recommended your Hard Hat be replaced every 4 years\\n 4) Are your Safety Gloves worn out? Any holes or tears? \\n 5) Finally, what about your Safety Glasses? They are your last line of defense against an eye injury\\n\\n\\nWhen your PPE is worn OR  is unable to be cleaned, request a replacement from your Area Supervisor or Safety Professional.

Our client was pulling ropes and wires across Highway 601 in Mt. Airy NC which is an extremely busy multi lane road.  Everyone worked extremely hard and everyone was attentive and participated in both our pre job and post job briefs. When it was time to hold traffic everyone was where they were supposed to be with paddles in hand. I can honestly say I could not be prouder of everyone. So THANK YOU!!!! Today would not have been as successful as it was without the hard work that you all did today. \\n\\nI also want to add that @Mark_Thompson is fresh out of BWZ class from last week and he set up a fantastic 14 cone merging taper all by himself with me there if he needed help or had questions. By the way he was not technically training today although he did.  \\nAlso, @Randolph_Westenfelder did a fantastic job on setting up his AP by an on ramp. He set a cone pattern that was laid out like a perfect diagram for traffic to easily know they could merge left or turn right to get onto the on ramp. \\n\\nAlso, Thank you @Susan_ONeal for stopping by and checking on us this morning. \\n\\n@Randolph_Westenfelder \\n@Stephen_Michael \\n@Katie_Mangvilay \\n@Mark_Thompson \\n@Robert_Jones \\n@Daniel_Immacolato \\n\\n⚠️All pictures were taken by the passenger⚠️',\n",

When it comes to flagging there are a few tips we have for when things go\\nwrong. Sure, it may be motorist error, but have we checked ourselves first?\\n \\n1.        Is traffic continuing to run your paddle? Make sure that you are\\nstanding in a visible place. Can traffic see you? Be sure to stay away from\\nblind curves and hills. These can take away from reaction time to the\\nmotorists. \\n2.        Also make sure you are not standing in front of obstructions\\nlike road signs and telephone poles. And as nice as the shade is on a hot day,\\nit can hide the brightness and retro-reflectivity of your PPE. \\n3.        When Mobile Flagging, if traffic keeps cutting between your\\nshadow vehicle and the client, your shadow vehicle may be too far from the\\nclient. Follow your proper roll ahead distance and stay clear of blind curves\\nand hills. \\n4.        Keep in mind that we want to have safe flagging locations with\\nescape routes AND proper site distance so we can be SEEN.\\n \\nStay tuned over the next few weeks for more tips on our other operations!
